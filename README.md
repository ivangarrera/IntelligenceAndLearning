# Intelligence And Learning
Projects about 'Artificial Intelligence' and 'Machine Learning'.

+ BFS.

    Breadth-first search algorithm over a graph, which contains information about the relationships between some actors
    and Kevin Bacon. The information comes from a JSON file.
    
+ Steering Example.

	In this example, I have implemented the steering behavior of an object, reacting to the mouse movement.
	
+ Evolutionary Steering Behaviors.

	In this program, I have implemented a system where a few 'vehicles' move across the space. The vehicles have to eat some food to increase their healthy and have to try not to eat the poison, because their health will fall. If the vehicles are healthy, they can get sons. 
	
+ Travelling Salesman Genetic Algorithm.

	This program calculates the path in which the sum of distances between cities is minimum. This implementation has on count the order of the cities to join them.
